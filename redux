 

import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
importR { createStore } from redux;


const store = createStore(reducer);



ReactDom.render(<Provider store={store}><App/></Provider>





Store has to be global so we need to pluggin store at the highest level

and highest level is index.js

we need to import couple of module one from react-redux and that package is called Provider

import { Provider } from react-redux;

Provide allow us to inject the global store.

we can wrap entire app with provider.

Now we need to build the store now so we import {creatStore } from redux
	
we need to pass store as property to provider so it will available for entire application.


if you want to access the store in your component we nned to map it.

we need to able to subcribe to the store so any changes thet happen to store automatically shouls be coming to your component.

and we need to dispatch action from component.

and our store to props and ctions we need two variable
